# Patch 2.2.0 (week 37&38)

Last fortnight didn't have much dev time.  
We have trading working - very effectively.  
We can inspect waypoints and make ship purchases, so we can scale.
And in our dev environment we have asteroid / gas giant mining and selling to relevant markets (But not pickup via haulers.)

This is a good spot for side-by-side playthrough, though it's not hands-off.
Going to try and give the 33-34 container with its own tags and dedicate a pi to it.

Here's my gameplay template that I want both containers to match side-by-side
* ✅✅ Buy probes and deploy them to initial markets (D&D, H, G, E, K, A1)
* ✅✅ Set command ship to autopilot
* Buy probes and deploy them to remaining markets

Milestones for this fortnight:
* Mining site class has management UI
* trading manager can do contracts
* mining manager can broadcast available goods to the trade manager
* Performance report (Grafana maybe?)
