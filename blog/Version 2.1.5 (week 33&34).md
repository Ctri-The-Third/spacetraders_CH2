# Week 33/34

We've archived all our previous work, and are starting afresh using the SDK as our foundation - though without being afraid to rework it substantially.  

This time we're starting UI / manual control first.
Initial goals
* ✅ Login with token / register user 
* Set up a websocket that returns all logging info to the users.
* Create a UI that lets you move / buy / sell


Goals we didn't know we had
* Restructure the SDK so that clients, models, and responses are all in their own sub-packages, instead of spread out as they are presently.
