# Patch 2.2.0 (week 35&36)

This fortnight we're introducing damage events and ship condition, which will be very insightful.

Copying over the milestones from last week

Dev Milestone 1:
* ✅ Support for events in the SDK 
* ✅ Support for condition and integrity in the DB
* ✅ Capture engine information in the DB (same as frame)
* ✅ Display condition and integrity in the UI
Gameplay:
* ✅ Deploy probes to key markets
* ✅ Visit all markets once

Milestone 2:
* ☑️ Waypoint panel 
 * ✅ Market
 * ✅ Shipyard
   * ✅ buy ships from UI
   * ✅ Fix the refreshing behaviour
 * Construction site
 * present ship dropdown
 * active ship can be set by url param / linked from ship
* ✅ satelitte indicator
* ✅ Pathfinder works again/ ships avble to navigate.
* Ship list has system filters and role filters
* Bootstrap the ship panel
* Why are ships failing to complete their processes sometimes?
  * 🩹 When ships refuel, they don't undock sometimes. Is this an issue of state imbalance between the ship object inside the "refuel" method and the one outside?
  * Ships with cargo should be sent to sell what they've got at the best location


Milestone 3: 
* ✅ Mining site class 
 * has management UI
 * ✅ knows what it can export
 * has strategy (disabled, extract_and_chill, extract_and_sell)
 * ❌ has assigned shpips (just extractors)
 * has sell locations (be those exchanges, or imports)
* mining site panel appears on waypoint panel 
* Trade panel shows requisite imports, and potential export destinations


### Downtime investigation

Every time we wake up/ come back to the game after a while, the ship is not in autopilot mode. 
Theory: Something about the hourly tick is causing the entry for the ship to stop
The code doesn't suggest that's happening though.
